# Load Balancer

The job of the load balancer is to fairly divide all clientsâ€™ requests among the pool of available servers

LBs can be placed between  

1. between client and web / app server
2. between web (generally server static content) and app (app server has all the business logic) server
3. between app server and DB server

**What does load balancer do**  -

1. Healthcheck of servers in the pool
2. TLS termination (learn more about TLS) - since request is terminated at LB itself, end servers burden is reduced
3. Can avoid Denial of Service attack

## Types of load balancers

1. Global server load balancing (GSLB): GSLB involves the distribution of traffic load across multiple geographical regions.
2. Local load balancing: This refers to load balancing achieved within a data center. They behave like a reverse proxy.

**Stateless and Stateful load balancers**  

1. Stateful - The stateful LB incorporates state information in its algorithm to perform load balancing.

2. Stateless - maintains no state. Mostly uses consistent hashing algo to reroute requests
