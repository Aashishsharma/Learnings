# Load Balancer

The job of the load balancer is to fairly divide all clientsâ€™ requests among the pool of available servers

LBs can be placed between  

1. between client and web / app server
2. between web (generally server static content) and app (app server has all the business logic) server
3. between app server and DB server

**What does load balancer do**  -

1. Healthcheck of servers in the pool
2. TLS termination (learn more about TLS) - since request is terminated at LB itself, end servers burden is reduced
3. Can avoid Denial of Service attack

## Types of load balancers

1. Global server load balancing (GSLB): GSLB involves the distribution of traffic load across multiple geographical regions.
2. Local load balancing: This refers to load balancing achieved within a data center. They behave like a reverse proxy.

**Stateless and Stateful load balancers**  

1. Stateful - The stateful LB incorporates state information in its algorithm to perform load balancing.

2. Stateless - maintains no state. Mostly uses consistent hashing algo to reroute requests

#### LB types based on layers

1. **Layer 4 LB** - load balancing done at transport layer based on protocol (TCP / UDP),  ensure that the same (TCP/UDP) communication ends up being forwarded to the same back-end server
2. **Layer 7 LB** - load balancing done at application url, LB check req.url, http headers and cookies to decide which end server the request needs to be redirected to.

**LB 4 vs LB 7 which to use when** - LB 4 is faster (used as Gloabl LB ), LB 7 (used as Local LB) takes responsibilities like rate limiting users, HTTP routing, and header rewriting.  
Mostly combination of L4 and L7 is used in large sace system

### Different LB tiers

1. **Tier-0 and Tier-1 LB** - this layer LBs divides incoming traffic on the basis of IP or some other algorithm like round-robin. DNS can be considered as the tier-0 load balancer
2. **Tier-2 LB** - this inclide Layer 4 LBs. Tier-2 LBs make sure that for any connection, all incoming packets are forwarded to the same tier-3 LBs. 
3. **Tier-3 LB** - this include Layer 7 LBs. these LBs are in direct contact with the back-end servers

### Another LB types

1. Hardware LBs - fast bu expensive, Hard to configre are hardware level hence rarely used
2. Software LBs - Programatically configured
3. Cloud LBs - Cloud owners (AWS) provide LBs
