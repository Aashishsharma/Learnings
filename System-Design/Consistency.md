# Consistency

In distributed systems, consistency may mean many things.  

1. One is that each replica node has the same view of data at a given point in time. 
2. The other is that each read request gets the value of the recent write.

## Types of consistency

#### 1. Eventual consistency

1. Weakest consistency model
2. Ensures that all the replicas will eventually return the same value to the read request, but the returned value isnâ€™t meant to be the latest value
3. Used in DNS system
4. Advantages - High availability

#### 2. Casual consistency

1. Ensures that the order of causally related operations in a distributed system is preserved
2. E.g - whatsapp group chat / facebook post reply, order is important
3. Implemented using Vector clock / dependency tracking 

#### Vector clocks
See Sequencer.md

#### Dependency tracking
Each message in in't metadata stores info about the message / action that is is dependent on
