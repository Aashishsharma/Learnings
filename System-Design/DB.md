# DB

## NoSQL

1. It is not NoSQL but is it Not Only SQL
2. It is a non relational DB (no Tables)
3. Flexible DB used in big data and real-time web apps

## SQL vs NoSQL

| Aspect                              | SQL                                                          | NoSQL                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uses fixed tables                   | Uses separate tables with foreign keys for related data.     | Uses JSON objects to store data, allowing for flexible schemas. |
| Referential integrity for data consistency    | Yes                                                | No    |
| Insert and retrieval                | Requires joins to retrieve all required data.                | Retrieval is straightforward without the need for joins.     |
| Adding new columns                  | Expensive, requires locking the database to make changes.   | Easy due to the flexible schema.                            |
| ACID properties                     | Follows ACID properties, ensuring consistency.              | ACID properties not guaranteed, updates may cause inconsistencies. |
| Usage                               | Commonly used in financial systems and transactional databases. | Preferred for systems prioritizing availability over consistency. |
| Read efficiency                     | Efficient for specific data retrieval due to structured queries. | May read entire documents for each query, potentially less efficient. |
| Relations                           | Implicit relationships maintained through foreign keys.     | Relationships not implicit, must be managed manually.       |
| Joins                               | Supports joins for combining related data from multiple tables. | Joins are manual and often require merging data manually.   |
| Normalization                       | Follows normalization principles for data organization.      | Not applicable, normalization is not typically used.        |
| Horizontal scaling                  | Not easy          | NoSQL makes it easier to scale out since the data related to a specific employee is stored in one document instead of multiple tables over nodes|
| License cost                        | expensive                                                    | open source                                                  |

## Types of NoSql

![alt text](PNG/db1.PNG "Title")  

### 1. Key value DB (Redis, Memcached and AWS Dynamo DB)  

1. Uses key-value methods like hash tables to store data in key-value pairs
2. Key serves as a unique or primary key, and the values can be anything ranging from simple scalar values to complex objects.
3. Allow easy partitioning and horizontal scaling of the data.

#### Usecases

1. Session-oriented applications

### 2. Document based DB (MongoDB, Google Cloud Firestore)

1. Store and retrieve documents (JSON, XML, BSON)

#### Usecases

1. Used in unstructured catalog data
2. e-commerce applications -  
a product has thousands of attributes, which is unfeasible to store in a relational database (need multiple joins from so many tables to get all product details)  
3. Storing user profile

```JSON
{
  "user_id": "123456",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "birthdate": "1990-05-15",
  "gender": "male",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postal_code": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "phone_numbers": [
    {
      "type": "mobile",
      "number": "123-456-7890"
    },
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "987-654-3210"
    }
  ],
  "social_media": {
    "twitter": "john_doe",
    "linkedin": "john.doe",
    "github": "johndoe"
  },
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "light",
    "language": "en",
    "notifications": {
      "email": true,
      "sms": false,
      "push": true
    }
  },
  "membership_status": "active",
  "registration_date": "2023-01-01",
  "last_login": "2024-02-05T10:15:30Z",
  "profile_picture": "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
  "bio": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed aliquam justo ac sem malesuada commodo."
}

```

**Note in one application only we can connect to both SQL and NoSql DB (store user profile in MongDB and other app data in MySql)**  -

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// MySQL connection configuration
const mysqlConnection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'my_database'
});
// MongoDB connection URL
const mongoUrl = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database';
// Promise to connect to MySQL
const connectToMySQL = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  mysqlConnection.connect((err) => {
    if (err) {
      reject(err);
      return;
    }
    console.log('Connected to MySQL');
    resolve();
  });
});
// Promise to connect to MongoDB
const connectToMongoDB = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  MongoClient.connect(mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then((mongoClient) => {
      console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
      resolve(mongoClient);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      reject(err);
    });
});
// Start Express server only when both connections are successful
Promise.all([connectToMySQL, connectToMongoDB])
  .then(() => {
    console.log('All connections successful. Starting Express server...');
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Express server started on port 3000');
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error connecting to databases:', err);
    // Handle error and exit application
    process.exit(1);
  });
// Close MySQL connection when the Node.js process exits
process.on('exit', () => {
  mysqlConnection.end();
  console.log('MySQL connection closed');
});
```

## 3. Graph DB ( Neo4J, OrientDB, and InfiniteGraph)

1. Use the graph data structure to store data
2. Nodes represent entities, edges represent relationship between entities

![alt text](PNG/db2.PNG "Title")  

#### Usecases

1. Social applications
2. To Drive analyses and decisions based on relationships between entities

## 4. Column based DB ( Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable, and Amazon SimpleDB)

1. Store data in columns instead of rows
2. Enable access to all entries in the database column quickly and efficiently

#### Usecases

1. Efficient for a large number of aggregation and data analytics queries  
(e.g. In financial institutions, thereâ€™s a need to sum the financial transaction over a period of time)

In traditional row based DB, to do sum, we need to traverse through each row  
In column based DB, just traverse through only 1 row and read all data sequentially

![alt text](PNG/db3.PNG "Title")  

## DB replication

Replication refers to keeping multiple copies of the data at various nodes (preferably geographically distributed) to achieve

1. availability
2. scalability
3. performance

**If we just do daat replication, we mean that all the data is stored in a single node, and we replicate the same data across multiple nodes (If the data can't be stored in one node we use partitioning)**

#### Issues with Data replication

1. Data consistency / integrity
2. Network latency
3. Conflict resolution - when multiple copies of the same data are modified independently in different. (How to resolve conflicts? 1. Automatic - DBMS systems checks timestamp of 2 writes, last-writer-wins 2. Manual - DBMS admin manually resolves conflicts)
4. Scalability issues - due to network latency to replicate data will all nodes
5. Synchronization overhead
6. Performance degradation
7. Failure recovery

#### DB replication types

##### Synchronous and Asynchronous

| Aspect                 | Synchronous Replication                                | Asynchronous Replication                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Define**             | Primary node to wait for ack from all nodes, and then send response to client | Primary node no wait            |
| Data Consistency       | Ensures strong consistency between replicas            | Eventual consistency                                   |
| Durability             | Guarantees that data is safely replicated before ACK    |Data eventaully replicated after ACK                   |
| Failure Handling       | Easier to detect failures and maintain consistency     | More fault-tolerant due to decoupled operation         |
| Read Scalability       | Generally better for read-heavy workloads               | May provide better read scalability with lagged replicas|
| Performance Impact     | Synchronous nature can introduce latency for writes     | Potential data loss in case of replica failure         |
| Network Dependency     | Relies heavily on stable and fast network connections  | Less dependent on network quality and latency          |
| Scalability            | May limit scalability due to synchronous nature        | Generally more scalable due to asynchronous operation  |
| Complexity             | Can introduce complexity in managing synchronous commits| Simplified configuration and management                |

##### Who does DB replication

| Entity                    | Examples                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Database Management Systems (DBMS) | SQL Server Replication, Oracle Data Guard, MySQL Replication, PostgreSQL streaming replication |
| Middleware Solutions      | IBM InfoSphere Data Replication, Oracle GoldenGate, Attunity Replicate |
| Third-party Replication Tools | SharePlex, HVR, Dbvisit Replicate |
| Cloud Service Providers   | Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database |

##### DB replication in MySQL -  

1. **Prepare the Master Database**:
   - Ensure that binary logging is enabled on the MySQL server acting as the master.
   - Set the `log_bin` parameter in the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf`).

2. **Create a Replication User on the Master**:
   - Create a dedicated MySQL user account for replication with appropriate privileges like `REPLICATION SLAVE` and `RELOAD`.

3. **Identify the Master's Binary Log File and Position**:
   - Note down the current binary log file and position on the master for replication initialization.

4. **Prepare the Slave Database**:
   - Install and configure MySQL on the slave node.
   - Ensure network connectivity between the master and slave nodes.

5. **Configure the Slave to Replicate from the Master**:
   - Edit the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf`) on the slave to configure it as a replica.
   - Configure replication parameters (`master_host`, `master_port`, `master_user`, `master_password`, `master_log_file`, `master_log_pos`) using master's information.

6. **Start the Slave and Begin Replication**:
   - Start the MySQL server on the slave node.
   - Start replication process on the slave using `START SLAVE` command.

##### DB replication in MS SQL server -

1. **Configure Replication on the Primary Server**:
   - Launch SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to the primary SQL Server instance.
   - Right-click on the primary database, navigate to Tasks > Replication > Configure Distribution.
   - Follow the wizard to configure distribution for the database. Choose the appropriate options based on your replication requirements.

2. **Select Replication Type**:
   - Choose the appropriate replication type based on your needs (e.g., transactional replication, snapshot replication, merge replication).

3. **Configure Publishers (Primary node)**:
   - Specify the publisher (primary server) for the replication topology.

4. **Install SQL Server on Subscriobers (Secondary Nodes)**:
   - Install SQL Server on the secondary nodes (replicas) where you want to replicate the database.
   - Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to configure each subscriber, specifying the publisher's connection properties,

5. **Initialize Subscribers**:
   - Initialize the subscribers by applying the initial snapshot or transaction log backup (depending on the replication type) to synchronize the data with the primary database.

### DB replication Models

Sync and Async DB replications are the type of replications, below are the models where either of (sync/async) replication can be used

### 1. primary-secondary replication (using sync / async)

- One node is designated as the primary. Itâ€™s responsible for processing any writes to data stored on the cluster
- Useful when workload is read heavy
- DB could be inconsistent if we use asynchronous replication
- Primary node is bottlneck and if primary node goes down any one of the secondary node (based on which node has most up-to-date data) becomes primary node

**3 ways in how DB does primary-secondary replication**

1. Statement based replication
   - primary node sends all SQL queries to secondary nodes
   - issue with nondeterministic functions in SQL queries, for e.g. NOW()
   - query seqeunce issue -  if second write query is sent first before the first write query to secondary nodes if first write query is slow

2. Write ahead log (WAL) shipping
   - primary node writes query to a log file and send archieve log files to secondary nodes (improved performance)
   - no issue of query sequence, since queries are logged first before execution

3. Row based replication
   - secondary nodes replicate the actual data changes rather then executing queries from primary node

### 2. multi-leader replication (using sync / async)

- There are multiple primary nodes that process the writes and send them to all other primary and secondary nodes to replicate.
- Better performance, scalobility and reliability
- Issue - write conflicts between multiple leaders

![alt text](PNG/db5.PNG "Title")  

**Avoding conflicts**

- Last write wins - Using their local clock, all nodes assign a timestamp to each update.

### 3. peer-to-peer / leaderless replication (using sync / async)

 All the nodes have equal weightage and can accept reads and writes requests.
 Issue - Data inconsistency

 ![alt text](PNG/db6.PNG "Title")  

###### Interview

In interview ask this Qs to the interviewer  

- Do you need low latency to the client or more consistency
  - If low latency - async replication
  - If more consistency - sunc replication

- Is the workload readh-heavy or write-heavy?
  - Read heavy - primary secondary replication
  - write heavy - peer-to-peer replication

**Note data replication is configured and handled at DBMS level, nothing to do in a code, we just have to connect to the primary server**.

**Problem - in my nodejs code I am connected to primary DB (MS SQL server) in a primary-secondary DB replication pattern, if the primary DB goes down, the MS SQL server will internally assign a secondary node as a new primary node, but the server address would be different, how will my nodejs client know the address of new primary server and get connected to this new server automatically**

**Answer - Using VNN (Virtual Network Name)** - VNN allows a client (Node.js) to connect to a replica without having to know the physical instance name of the SQL Server.  

```javascript
const sql = require('mssql');
const config = {
  user: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  server: 'your_listener_or_vnn_address', // Listener or VNN address from SSMS
  database: 'your_database',
};

let pool;
async function connect() {
  try {
    pool = await sql.connect(config);
    console.log('Connected to SQL Server');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error connecting to SQL Server:', err);
    // Implement retry logic here
  }
}
// Call connect function to establish the initial connection
connect();
// Monitor for errors and handle failover
pool.on('error', async err => {
  console.error('Database error:', err);
  // Check if the error indicates primary node failure
  if (err.code === 'ESOCKET' || err.code === 'ECONNRESET') {
    // Handle failover by reconnecting
    try {
      await connect(); // here VNN would be same, but it will connect to new primary server internally
      console.log('Reconnected to the new primary server');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error reconnecting to the new primary server:', error);
      // Implement further error handling or retry logic if needed
    }
  }
});
// Example query execution
async function executeQuery() {
  try {
    const result = await pool.request().query('SELECT * FROM your_table');
    console.log(result.recordset);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', err);
  }
}

```

## DB partitioning aka sharding

At some point, a single node-based database isnâ€™t enough to tackle the load. We might need to distribute the data over many nodes but still export all the nice properties of relational databases.  

Partion must be balanced. If partitioning is unbalanced, the majority of queries will fall into a few partitions

### 1. Vertical sharding

- Column based partitioning.
- Vertical sharding is often used in scenarios where certain columns of a table are accessed more frequently or there is blob column in the table
- increases the speed of data retrieval from a table consisting of columns with very wide text or a binary large object (blob)
- sit with stakeholders to understand which tables / columns to be partitioned based on requirement

 ![alt text](PNG/db7.PNG "Title")

### 2. Horizontal sharding

- Row based partitioning

#### 1. key-range based sharding

Note - When partitioning tables with foreign key relationships, ensure that the referenced rows are stored in the same shard as the referencing rows. for referential integrity.  

 ![alt text](PNG/db8.PNG "Title")

**Get data from multiple shards** -

```javascript
// Function to query horizontally sharded database
async function queryShardedDatabase(query) {
    const shards = await determineShardsForQuery(query);
    const results = [];
    // Execute queries on all shards concurrently and wait for all to finish
    await Promise.all(shards.map(async (shard) => {
        const result = await executeQueryOnShard(query, shard);
        results.push(result);
    }));
    const mergedResult = mergeResults(results);
    return mergedResult;
}
// Placeholder function to determine shards for query
async function determineShardsForQuery(query) {
    // Logic to determine which shards contain relevant data for the query
    // This might involve querying metadata or using a shard-routing mechanism
    // For simplicity, returning mock shard IDs
    return ['shard1', 'shard2', 'shard3'];
}
// Placeholder function to execute query on a shard
async function executeQueryOnShard(query, shard) {
    // Logic to execute the query on the specified shard
    // For simplicity, returning a mock result
    return `Result from ${shard}`;
}
// Placeholder function to merge results from multiple shards
function mergeResults(results) {
    // Logic to merge results from multiple shards
    // For simplicity, concatenating the results into a single string
    return results.join(', ');
}
// Example usage
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30";
queryShardedDatabase(query)
    .then(result => console.log('Query result:', result))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error executing query:', error));
```

**Code to determine on which shard query needs to be executed**  

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mssql = require('mssql');

const app = express();

// Placeholder function to establish connection to a shard
async function connectToShard(shardInfo) {
    try {
        // Establish connection to the shard using shardInfo (e.g., hostname, port)
        await mssql.connect(shardInfo);
        console.log(`Connected to shard ${shardInfo.name}`);
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error connecting to shard ${shardInfo.name}:`, error);
        return false;
    }
}
// Function to determine shard based on user input
// this is for key-range based sharding
// in hash based sharding, shard would be selected based on the hash
function determineShard(userId) {
    return userId <= 1000 ? shard1 : shard2;
}
// Placeholder shard objects
let shard1;
let shard2;
// Define route to handle user queries
app.get('/query', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId } = req.query;
    const shard = determineShard(parseInt(userId));

    if (!shard) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid shard' });
    }

    // Example query execution
    try {
        const request = shard.request();
        const result = await request.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE userId = ${userId}`);
        return res.json(result.recordset);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error executing query:', error);
        return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
});
// Connect to multiple shards and start Express server only when all shards are connected
async function startServer() {
    const shard1Info = { name: 'shard1', user: 'user', password: 'password', server: 'shard1.example.com', database: 'database' };
    const shard2Info = { name: 'shard2', user: 'user', password: 'password', server: 'shard2.example.com', database: 'database' };

    const shardPromises = [
        connectToShard(shard1Info),
        connectToShard(shard2Info)
    ];

    const shardConnections = await Promise.all(shardPromises);

    // Check if all shards are connected successfully
    if (shardConnections.every(conn => conn)) {
        shard1 = new mssql.Request(); // Reuse connection to shard 1
        shard2 = new mssql.Request(); // Reuse connection to shard 2

        const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
        app.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
        });
    } else {
        console.error('Failed to connect to all shards. Server will not start.');
    }
}
// Start the server
startServer().catch(error => {
    console.error('Error starting server:', error);
    process.exit(1);
});

```

#### 1. Hash based sharding

- Hash function is applied on one of the attribute from the table

In below example, we have 4 shards and hash function is applied on the value column, hash func is Value % 4, based on the hash value the row is added on that particular shard

 ![alt text](PNG/db9.PNG "Title")

**Rebalancing issue** - in hash based partitioning, based on value mod (no.of nodes), if no.of nodes increase the hash function return value would change, in this case we need to rebalance the data to appropriate shards. This is the issue.

##### **Solving rebalancing issue**

##### 1. Using Dynamic / Extended Hashing

##### 2. Using Consistent Hashing

#### Range based vs Hash based sharding

| Feature                 | Range-Based Partitioning                                          | Hash-Based Partitioning                                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key Distribution        | Data is partitioned based on a specified range of key values.       | Data is partitioned based on the output of a hash function.   |
| Key Range Definition    | Requires explicit definition of key ranges for each partition.     | Does not require explicit definition of key ranges.          |
| Data Distribution       | Uneven distribution may occur if key ranges are not evenly sized.  | Provides a more even distribution of data across partitions.  |
| Query Efficiency        | Well-suited for range queries that involve consecutive key values. | May require scanning multiple partitions for range queries.  |
| Insert/Update Efficiency| May require rebalancing if key distribution changes significantly.| Generally does not require rebalancing for key distribution changes. |
| Example Use Cases       | Time-based partitioning (e.g., partitioning data by date ranges). | High-throughput systems where even data distribution is crucial. |

### Issues with sharding

1. If we need to use JOIN queries across shards
   - run individaul joins on all shards, build merge logic in application code

## DB replication and partitioning combined

1. Create shards, and for few / each shard create DB replica for those shards
2. So, in Nodejs write code to connect to each shard, but instead of giving each shard's server address, give VNN address of each shard
