Lead vs opportunity vs customer  

If there is a decision split, we use journey builder (JB) else automation studio (AS)

## Data extensions
(Tables)  
Created under email studio / content builder  

To send emails from JB/AS with any DE as a sorce, it needs to be sendable  
Thus we need to add 1 mandatory field in DE with datatype as emailaddress (see below)  
emailaddr type should only be 1, if we need to store multiple emails, store others in text as a datatype
