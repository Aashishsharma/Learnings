## SOLID Principles
**Why?**  
Solid Design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!  

1. Single Responsibility
2. Open/Closed
3. Liskov Substitution
4. Interface Segregation
5. Dependency Inversion

### 1. Single resposibility
This principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
