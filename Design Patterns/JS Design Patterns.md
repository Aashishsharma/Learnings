## JS Design Patterns
A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design  
It is a blueprint/template that you can use and modify to solve your particular problem  

**Why to use?**  
1. Reusing patterns assists in preventing minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development process
2. Certain patterns can actually decrease the overall file-size footprint of our code by avoiding repetition

**Three main types of Design patterns**  
1. Creational DP
2. Structural DP
3. Behavioural DP

### 1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.e, especially if you need to create many different types of many different objects  
**Patterns falling in this category**  
1. Constructor
2. Factory
3. Abstract
4. Prototype
5. Singleton 
6. Builder.  

### 2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same.  
Patterns that fall under this category include: Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy.

**Patterns falling in this category**  
1. Decorator
2. Facade
3. Flyweight
4. Adapter
5. Proxy

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.

**Patterns falling in this category**  
1. Iterator
2. Mediator
3. Observer
4. Visitor
