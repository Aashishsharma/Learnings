## Formik
Helps with -  
1. Managing form state
2. Handling form submission
3. Validation and eror message

In the code base  
oldYoutubeform com is to understand how formik works
in the youtubeform comp - we remove the boilerplatecode

### IMP
To integrate any UI library like materialUI with Formik, we have to use renderProp pattern (function as a children) - see ChakraInput in re-usable-formik-controls section
