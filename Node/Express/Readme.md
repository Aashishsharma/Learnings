## Express
It is fast, unopniated (vary basic at it's core, gives full control on how you want to develope), **web framework for Nodejs**

#### Why?
1. Makes building web applications easier
2. Used for both server rendered webpages (html)(also know as static server) as well as API/Microservices
3. Extremley light, fast and free
4. Full control on req, res.
5. Popular
6. Provides middleware capabilities

#### Middleware functions
1. These are functions that have access to req and res objects.
2. Middleware is executed after client request is and before the callback func written for the client req.
2. Any code can be executed, express has both inbuilt and 3rd party middlewares
3. We can add any no. of middleware in a single request
