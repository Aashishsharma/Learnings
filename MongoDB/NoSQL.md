#### Types of NoSQL
1. Document Databases (MondoDB, CouchDB)  
Store data similar to JSON. Completely schemaless at DB level. So applications can be very dynamic.  
In such apps, user can create their own custom profile, like some will have address, bio and other things, some can just use name
2. Column DataBases (Apache Cassendra)  
Optimised to read and write data in columns instead of rows.  
Great for analytics as it reduces dick I/O requests
3. Key-Value Stores (Redis, Couchbase server)  
ideal for huge databases with very simple data
4. Cache Systems (Redis, Memcache)
5. Graph Databases (Neo4J)
